# Finance App

This project is a full-stack application built with Next.js version 14 and TypeScript. It's based on the [Next.js tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn), with additional features and SQL scripts.

You can try the live version of the app [here](https://finance-app-mu-five.vercel.app/).

## Features

- **Next.js and TypeScript**: The app is built with Next.js, a powerful framework for building server-side rendered React applications + TypeScript.

- **Data Fetching**: The app fetches user data from a mock API. This demonstrates the app's ability to work with external APIs and handle asynchronous operations.

- **Database Handling**: The app uses serverless SQL and Prisma ORM for database handling. This allows for robust, type-safe database operations.

- **Testing**: The app is tested with Jest and Cypress frameworks. Jest is used for unit and integration tests, while Cypress is used for end-to-end tests. This ensures the app's reliability and correctness.

- **Schema Validation**: The app uses ZOD for schema validation. This ensures that the data the app works with is in the correct format and meets certain criteria.
  
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js is integrated into the project for seamless user authentication, providing a secure and customizable login experience.
  
- **Other things**: Shadcn, Tailwind, clsx
